            <p class="dropword" style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Unsustainable practices, such as burning fossil fuels can destroy habitats, destabilizing ecosystems. If an area full of trees is cleared for extraction of crude oil, a species who relies on those trees for shelter or food may reduce in population or go extinct. This means anything that preys on it may starve and start dying off, and anything that species eats may begin to overpopulate. This can cause food to be scarce, as there is more competition for it. Climate change, caused by non-renewable energy sources can affect biomes in major ways. Biomes were usually consistent for thousands of years, however recent shifts make the biomes hotter and dryer. It changes the biome faster than some species can adapt, destabilizing the ecosystem again. A destabilized ecosystem is very vulnerable to any more changes, or invasive species, and it can reduce biodiversity majorly.

            Our solution uses renewable energy sources, which avoids contributing to climate change while making energy. However, the manufacture and disposal could release toxins into the environment, and because of biomagnification and bioaccumulation, can affect certain ecosystems negatively. We will avoid this by preventing the release of these toxins, using safe and sustainable manufacturing practices and setting up a recycling program to prevent our product from being left in the environment.

            <p class="dropword">We plan to make our windmill out of plastic. However, plastic is a very general term for the material. There are many different types of plastic, all with different physical and chemical traits. We will need to pick a plastic with a chemical composition that can resist the elements, be cheap to manufacture and easy to fix, while also be recyclable. It is preferable to use a plastic that doesnâ€™t chemically react with any common substances, such as water or air.</p>

            <p class="dropword">Our solution fundamentally relies on electricity and circuits. The whole purpose of our product is to generate electricity sustainably, and store the power in a battery for later. We will need to optimize our circuit for the highest possible efficiency, while also balancing cost and ease of manufacturing. The voltage, current, and resistance need to be correct so we provide enough electricity to the LED, without overloading it and making sure the battery can supply that power.</p>

            <p class="dropword">If humanity ever lands, explores, or lives on another planet, a sustainable energy source is needed. The closest planet that looks attractive to live on, Mars, has very high speed winds and dust storms. The weather on Mars is already extreme, and if we use fossil fuels we could repeat global warming as we did on Earth, making weather even more extreme and unpredictable. Our product can complement other sustainable practices that could be used on Mars, such as growing plants. </p>
