        <h2>Introducing the Roofmill</h2>
        <p>Our solution to the problem is creating a unique type of windmill that charges a battery. An LED light and heater will be connected to this battery, creating light and heat. These windmills are attached to roofs of houses, allowing them to be more structurally sound and less unappealing to the eye, unlike some conventional windmills. It will be made out of strong plastic so it is cheap to manufacture, repair, and strong enough to withstand the elements. </p>

        <h2>What if people don't want this on their roof?</h2>
        <p>We obviously can’t stop people from not wanting the Roofmill on their property, however the benefits outweigh the negatives. It saves money overtime, as the Roofmill will generate it from the wind for free, providing lighting and heat.</p>

    <div class="Litemholder">
        <h2>Will it generate enough power?</h2>
        <p>To produce enough electricity, there will be multiple Roofmills on a house. They can be attached to the roof, and if needed, can be attached to walls. It also has an advantage that some similar energy sources, like solar, do not. While lights and heating are being powered by the battery, the Roofmill can still produce electricity and charge the battery, making it able to power the lights and heating for longer.</p>

        <summary>Defining the Problem</summary>
        <div class="dropcontent">

            <p class="dropword">We identified that a major problem is that the DRC, a major country in sub-saharan Africa, does not have much access to electricity. While there is electricity in the main cities, many communities who make up the majority of the population have no access to electricity. The national grid is small, and isn’t expanding very much. The most important use of electricity is for lighting and heating. Residents without electricity have to resort to using fires or oil lamps.</p>

        <summary>Why is this a problem?</summary>
        <div class="dropcontent">
            <img class="dropimg" src="https://images.twinkl.co.uk/tr/raw/upload/u/ux/lightbulb-1875247-1920_ver_1.jpg">
            <p class="dropword">This is a problem because many useful and essential technologies such as fridges and ovens require electricity. It is also a problem because fires and oil lamps, the alternatives to having no electrically powered lighting or heating are very dangerous and harm the environment. If not contained properly, fires can break out, potentially damaging hundreds of buildings. They also release carbon emissions, which are bad for the environment and your health. These emissions can pool indoors, and inhaling them can lead to illnesses, and even death.</p>

            <p class="dropword">We brainstormed many ideas to solve this problem. We were limited to renewable energy, as we didn’t want to release carbon emissions like fires or oil lamps. We narrowed our options down to solar energy or wind energy, as they are readily available almost everywhere. We settled on wind energy, as it is a lot more consistent of an energy source than solar, which can be completely rendered useless by bad weather. While wind is also subject to the weather, it is almost at least slightly windy in an area.</p>

            <p class="dropword">We first drew a drawing of our intended solution. This allowed us to easily tweak and refine our design before we built the prototype. We then made the design of the windmill in 3D modeling software. The windmill is the most important part of the design, so we must make sure it is the best it can be. We plan to 3D print the prototype, so the 3D modeling software makes it easy to visualize and easy to 3D print it.</p>

            <p class="dropword">After we modeled the windmill in a 3D modeling software, we proceeded to 3D print it. Our prototype is a lot smaller than the real product would be. This allows us to spend less money if we are to change the design, and more importantly, to fit the print on the 3D printer.</p>

            <img class="dropimg" src="./download.png"> 
            <p class="dropword">While we haven’t gotten to the testing phase, we will make sure to test our prototype thoroughly. We will keep track of successes and failures with the design, which is very important for the next phase, iterating. We will test durability, energy production, overall efficiency, and cost to maintain. This is one of the most important phases for us, as we want the design to be almost perfect before we start manufacturing in mass.</p>

        <summary>Iterating</summary>
        <div class="dropcontent">
            <p class="dropword">We will discover problems along the way with testing in the future, we will make small changes to improve our design. If durability, energy production, overall efficiency, and cost to maintain doesn’t meet our expectations we will find ways to improve the design to meet our requirements. For example if our design is too fragile, we could change materials to make it more durable.</p>
