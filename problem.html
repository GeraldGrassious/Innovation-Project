        <h2>What is the problem?</h2>
        <p>All over the world, 675 million people (~8.4% of people on earth) live without access to electricity, specifically for the use in lighting and heating. Most of them are in sub-saharan Africa. One of the countries most affected is the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), where 81% of the population doesn't have access to electricity. In the DRC, and many other countries suffering from the same problems, residents have to use fires or oil lamps. While these provide heat and light, they can be very dangerous. If not controlled properly, fire can spread uncontrollably. They also produce harmful byproducts in the form of gases, such as carbon monoxide, these gases can accumulate indoors and pose a major risk to the residents health. This carbon also gets into the atmosphere, contributing to global carbon emissions.</p>
