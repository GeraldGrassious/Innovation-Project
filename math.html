            <p class="dropword">We will need to collect data through various methods to create a roadmap of what communities to install our product in. We will survey communities around the DRC, and prioritize ones far from current infrastructure, as they will be the last to be reached if the national grid is expanded. We will also track our progress by collecting data on how much energy was used and made by our product in communities we’ve installed it in. These graphs will be double bar graphs, one bar being the energy consumed and the other being the energy produced by our product. This helps us iterate and tune our solution to specific communities.</p>

            <p class="dropword">Manufacturing, transporting, and installing our product will cost a lot of money, and we will need to make an accurate and effective budget to reflect that. If we don’t budget, we may experience severe cost overruns and go bankrupt, or not be able to afford any new raw materials. We also have to account for employee salaries, making sure we have enough money to pay them. This is obviously something we want to avoid. We also need to adapt incase of new situations affecting our budget, like taxes or tariffs on certain materials. We will add a safety net to our budget, so that we can still support ourselves if unforeseen circumstances happen. We may need to take out large loans to initially afford the materials and factory, which means we need to account for interest when paying it back. In Kinshasa, the capital of the DRC, there is a warehouse that costs $11000 per month. Being located in the capital means there are many people to hire, and easier access to materials.</p>

            <p class="dropword">Houses vary in size and shape, and we will need to account for that when installing the windmills of our solution. We plan to install these windmills on the roofs of houses, and because of the large variety of roof sizes and shapes, we will need to measure and cut the windmill into the desired length. If it’s too long, some parts will be unsupported by the roof and might collapse. If it’s too short, we miss out on potential energy. We also need to design our windmill with the most efficient, while easy to manufacture shape. We need geometry to do this, and combining the measurements we can calculate the volume and estimate the price.</p>

            <p class="dropword">To manufacture our product efficiently and at the lowest cost, we will try to employ robots and automatic manufacturing practices when possible. This removes the human component, lowering cost (as we won’t need to pay them a salary) and eliminating human error. It would use variables to store values, like the amount of parts completed or how far it is into making a part. It will use functions to manufacture the part easier. We will need coding to make these robots do what we want, and we may need to hire someone to do it for us. We could also implement code into our product that will automatically turn on the lights when it gets dark, and could have a schedule so it can be as consistent as possible.
