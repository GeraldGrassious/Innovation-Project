        <h2>Goal 7: Affordable and Clean Energy</h2>
        <p>Goal 7 of the UN's SDG is to ensure access to clean, reliable, and sustainable energy to all by 2030. The UN predicts that we must improve our energy efficiency at double the rate we are currently to meet the goal by 2030. While renewable energy sources contribute to about 30% of electricity worldwide, they aren't very prominent in heating and transportation.</p>

        <h2>What is Canada doing to meet this goal?</h2>
        <p>Canada is one of the largest consumers of energy, despite having a tiny population compared to its closest neighbour, the United States. This is mostly due to its colder climate, we necessitates the use of heating, consuming valuable energy. Canada has started transitioning to renewable energy sources such as solar, nuclear, wind, and hydro. </br> </br> The government of Canada has set up the Energy Innovation Program, funding and supporting research into renewable energy. Sustainable Development Technology Canada (SDTC) helps companies develop and implement energy efficient and environmentally friendly sources of energy. More stringent energy efficiency regulations have been put in place, requiring manufacturers to improve the energy efficiency of their products. The Canadian government predicts that 90-100% of its energy will be from renewable sources.</p>

        <h2>What is being done worldwide to meet this goal?</h2>
        <p>Due to the evergoing issue of climate change, the world has been moving towards more sustainable energy sources. These include solar, hydro, wind, and many other renewable sources. However, improvements and shifts to renewable sources have been slow in the transportation and the heating sector. In 1998, only 78% of the world had access to electricity, and in 2021 91% of people had access to electricity. The UN estimates it won’t be enough. By 2030, 660 million people will still be left without access to electricity, and 2 billion people will still rely on fossil fuels for cooking. It’s estimated that to reach the goal on time, between $35 billion and $40 billion USD needs to be spent every year.</p>

        <h2>What is being done in the DRC to meet this goal?</h2>
        <p>The DRC suffers a lot from lack of access to electricity within the country. The national grid is very undeveloped, and doesn’t reach a majority of the population. In November of 2024, the DRC launched the National Energy Compact, aiming to increase access to electricity. The goal is to increase electricity access in the country from 21.5% to 62.5%. It is estimated $36 billion will be needed to achieve this goal. However, the DRC lacks private investments in the project. The UN pointed out the lack of vision and clear objectives as a major reason. Another issue is that while regulations about electricity were liberalized, there are still major delays around setting up regulatory bodies. Despite these issues, the DRC is committed to try and fix this issue.

        <h2>How does our solution address the goal?</h2>
        <p>Our solution addresses the electricity problem in the DRC by giving a sustainable, cheap, easy to use, and effective way to provide light and heating to communities. This especially benefits remote communities, who are very far from the national grid and may not even be connected to it when it is expanded. The system can be completely disconnected from the national grid, and can be used while a community doesn’t have any outside access to electricity. This is achieved by using a wind turbine that can be attached to the edges of house roofs or even in them if the need arises. This wind turbine is connected to a battery, to store the electricity for later use at night, when light and heating is needed.</p>

        <h2>Physical Geography</h2>
        <p>The continued use of fires and oil lamps in the DRC can significantly contribute to global emissions. While the emissions from these sources may seem unsubstantial, with the rest of the world moving towards renewable energy, these sources will become a bigger part of global emissions if this problem isn’t solved. Climate change impacts the DRC more significantly than other countries. Between June to August, the DRC experiences a dry season, where temperatures can reach 27°C. With climate change creating drier and hotter climates, this already dry season could become even dryer, and heat could soar higher than ever before. </br> However, the bigger problem happens when the monsoon season arrives between September to May. This season has heavy Monsoon rains, which are vital for agriculture and life throughout the DRC. Climate change reduces the amount of precipitation during this season, potentially causing some communities to not get enough rainfall. It also makes the monsoon rains less predictable. For hundreds of years, these rains have come in normal, predictable routines. However, now they may arrive too early or too late, making them unpredictable for residents.
            </br>
            </br>
            Ethical concerns may arise, due to the continued use of child labor in the DRC. The DRC is home to 50% of the world's cobalt reserves, a vital component of lithium-ion batteries. These batteries are essential for our product, as it relies on charging a battery. Unfortunately, children are made to work in these mines, in very dangerous and harmful conditions. Despite regulations outlawing such practices, monitoring and enforcement is poor. The COTECCO project combats child labor in these mines, by spreading awareness and improving enforcement of regulations. Much more work has to be done across the country to fully get rid of such practices.

        <h2>Human Geography</h2>
        <p>Making a community liveable greatly benefits the population. One of the most important components in a liveable community is access to electricity. Electricity powers almost every technology we use in our daily lives, from phones to lights. However, the national grid in the DRC is very underdeveloped. It covers only a small portion of the country, leaving most residents completely in the dark. This reduces the liveability of communities in the DRC, as there isn’t electricity to effectively filter water, cook food, and important medical devices. Residents have to use unsustainable alternatives, such as burning fossil fuels. The darkness in the DRC also increases the crime rate, an already huge problem in the DRC. Out of the astounding 54 countries in Africa, the DRC had the highest crime rate. Without public lighting, crimes such as theft and sexual assault are far easier to pull off. 
        </br>
        </br>
        The DRC suffers a lot from infant mortality. The infant mortality rate in the DRC is ~48 per 1000 births, more than 10x higher than in Canada. A lot of this is due to lack of access to medical equipment. Access to electricity would be the first step to reducing the infant mortality rate in the DRC, as many medical devices require electricity to function. It could also lead people to stay in their communities, instead of moving to bigger cities with electricity. This also may lead to a lower emigration rate, leaving the country with more people to work jobs, helping the economy.
